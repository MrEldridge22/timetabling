### Planning
# Web based subject changer
# Input box for student ID, get current classes, select which one to change and then output this to a form
# Students circle which option they want to move into and go around and sign.
# Once signed off, go back into student ID, hit assign subject change
# Display class sizes next to subject name (line through full subjects??)
# Write new data into sfx / tfx file
